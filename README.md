# Project Title

Temperature and Air Pollution Correlation Analysis

# Description

In this project, we are looking at whether or not there is a correlation between an increase in the temperature globally and an increase in PM2.5 air pollution. Our data summary includes the countries USA, Canada, Mexico, Chile, and Colombia. The criteria we have covered to help understand the subject is to first collect the historical data as a baseline. this includes the population data as well and is created into both line and regression charts to view their relationship. Furthermore, we have used scatterplots to analyze the pollution trends between the northern and southern hemispheres, these also include relationship factors such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and air pollution. Finally, the project also included mappings of countries with Coal plants, this was used to compare the pollution density between areas with varying numbers of coal plants.

# Dependencies/Installing

Dependencies to view the map plots require the user to download and install GeoPandas and all its dependencies. This is within Anaconda

Further information can be found here: https://geopandas.org/en/stable/getting_started/install.html

It will also require an OS to be used and VSCode or Jupyter Notebooks to view/run code written in Python

Python can be downloaded using this link: https://www.python.org/downloads/

Anaconda can be downloaded through this link: https://www.anaconda.com/download (VSCode and Jupyter Notebook are included)

# Executing program

To execute the program, ensure you have installed Anaconda and have access to either VSCode or Jupyter Notebook

Otherwise, you will need Python installed which can be found here: https://www.python.org/downloads/

Then, you can clone the repository to your local. 
This can be done through the command: git clone < https://github.com/DiegoMartorell1620/Project1_Team7.git >

Using GitBash or Command Prompt, you can change the directory to the folder containing this project, then you can cd into the project directory. To do: cd <project_directory>

Once within the project directory, as a measure make sure to check any outstanding dependencies, especially for Python, this can be run to help: pip install -r requirements.txt

The project should preferably be opened and executed in Jupyter Notebook

If you cannot see any servers running you can type http://localhost:8888/ in the URL and it should also work within the browser of the Notebook

 Within the notebook, the file we need to run is titled Project 1 - Team 7.ipynb and it is within the Project_1_Team_7 Folder

 If you press shift + enter it is possible to run the Jupyter Notebook or even use the run drop-down option in the Jupyter Notebook User Interface
